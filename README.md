# Case study: Vacaresti PA Tree Inventory
## July 2021
## Cosmin Pârlog

This repository contains the full data analysis cycle on the data base resulting from the first complete tree inventory inside of the **Vacaresti Protected Area**, the first protected urban wetland in Bucharest, Romania.

The preliminary results were used to make a Stakeholder Report (available here: https://parcnaturalvacaresti.ro/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Studiu-Raport_GCLArbori_Final.pdf) while a more thorough analysis is documented here which was used in my Master’s dissertation.

Moreover, in this case study I have applied the knowledge gained after recently obtaining my Google Data Analyst Professional Certificate form Coursera.
