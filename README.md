## Cosmin Pârlog

This repository contains the full data analysis cycle on the data base resulting from the first tree inventory inside of the **Vacaresti Protected Area** the first protected urban wetland from Bucharest, Romania.

The preliminary results were used to make a Stakeholder Report (available here: https://parcnaturalvacaresti.ro/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Studiu-Raport_GCLArbori_Final.pdf) while a more thorough analysis is documented here and also was used in my Master’s dissertation.

In this case study I have also applied the knowledege gained after recently obtaning the Google Data Analist Professional Certificate form Coursera.
