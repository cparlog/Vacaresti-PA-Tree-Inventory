# Case study: Vacaresti PA Tree Inventory
## July 2021

This repository contains the full data analysis cycle on the data base resulting from the first tree inventory inside of the *Vacaresti Protected Area* , an urban wetland in Bucharest, Romania.

The preliminary results were used to make a Stakeholder Report [available here] (https://parcnaturalvacaresti.ro/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Studiu-Raport_GCLArbori_Final.pdf) while a more thorough analysis is documented here and also was used in my Masterâ€™s dissertation.
